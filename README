#Vagrant Fedora 20 Box

##Install Vagrant Trigger Plugin
`vagrant plugin install vagrant-triggers`

##First Run
`VAGRANT_SSH_USERNAME=username VAGRANT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY=/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa VAGRANT_SSH_PUBLIC_KEY=/home/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant up`

##Missing
-Need a way to handle git configuration.
-Need a way to handle opening and forwarding of ports. Currently, I opened up the VirtualBox gui and forwarded the ports.
-Add an empty ./mnt or ./mount folder and allow user to specify what, if anything gets mounted there. i.e. ./mount/opt -> vm's /opt or whatever.
